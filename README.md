This is a silly/basic game simulator for the game Welcome to Your Perfect Home.

If you're familiar with the game, then everything should make sense, even if it's not exactly as you're expecting.

This exists so that you don't have to carry or shuffle any cards. You still need player sheets.

Also, don't mind the code. It works. That's all that matters.
